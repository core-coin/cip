<!-- This is the suggested template for new CIPs. Note that a CIP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your CIP, use an abbreviated title for the filename, `cip-ID.md`, where "ID" is the CIP ID. The title should be 44 characters or fewer. -->
<!-- Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the CIP. -->

## Abstract
<!-- A short (~200 words) description of the technical issue being addressed. -->

## Motivation
<!-- The motivation is critical for CIPs aiming to change the Core protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem the CIP addresses. CIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright. -->

## Specification
<!-- The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. This section should be detailed enough to allow for competing, interoperable implementations on all current Core platforms. -->

## Rationale
<!-- The rationale elaborates on the specification by describing the motivations behind the design and the reasons for particular design decisions. It should discuss alternative designs considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community and should address significant objections or concerns raised during discussions. -->

## Backwards Compatibility
<!-- All CIPs introducing backward incompatibilities must include a section detailing these incompatibilities and their severity. The CIP should explain how the author proposes to address these incompatibilities. CIP submissions lacking a comprehensive backward compatibility analysis may be rejected outright. -->

## Test Cases
<!-- Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for CIPs affecting consensus changes. Other CIPs can opt to include links to relevant test cases if applicable. -->

## Implementation
<!-- Implementations should be finalized before any CIP receives "Final" status, but they don't need to be completed before the CIP is accepted. Though achieving consensus on the specification and rationale prior to coding is beneficial, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" remains useful for resolving many API details discussions. -->

## Security Considerations
<!-- All CIPs must include a section discussing the security implications and considerations relevant to the proposed change. This section should provide details important for security discussions, highlight potential risks, and be referenced throughout the proposal's lifecycle. CIP submissions lacking the "Security Considerations" section will be rejected. A CIP cannot achieve "Final" status without a Security Considerations discussion deemed satisfactory by the reviewers. -->
