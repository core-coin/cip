> CIP stands for Core Improvement Proposal.

A CIP is a design document that provides information to the Core community or introduces a new feature to Core, its processes, or its environment. The document should present a clear technical specification and a rationale for the proposed feature. It is the responsibility of the CIP author to build consensus within the community and to document any dissenting opinions.
