<!-- This is the suggested template for new CIP. Note that a CIP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your CIP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `cip-ID.md`, where "ID" is CIP ID. The title should be 44 characters or less. -->
<!-- Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the CIP. -->
We introduce a standard for crypto addresses — ICAN — with HRP and checksum, similar to what we all are using for current financial transactions. ICAN stands for International Crypto Account Number.
Only hexadecimal characters are used to minimize the size of the address in the Blockchain storage.

## Abstract
<!-- A short (~200 words) description of the technical issue being addressed. -->
The ICAN facilitates the communication and processing of the transactions. It allows exchanging account identification details in a machine-readable form.

## Motivation
<!-- The motivation is critical for CIP that wants to change the Core protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the CIP solves. CIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright. -->
Find reliable and financially friendly Blockchain addresses for the community. Easy to understand and easy to interpret, but still compatible with modern financial solutions. The checksum is applied in this structure to ensure minimum risk of mistyping the address. ICAN is reflexing the financial standards, which people are using already to simplify the matter for them.

## Specification
<!-- The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current Core platforms. -->
Crypto Address consists of:

1. Crypto Identifier - CID (HRP)
1. Checksum
1. BCAN - Account address (Hexadecimal)

### Crypto Identifier (CID)

The Crypto Identifier (human-readable part) uniquely identifies the network.
This part must contain 2 Hexadecimal characters.
Currently Unassigned and Deleted [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2#Current_codes) are available.

### Checksum

2 digits are calculated with modulo 97 from BCAN.

Why we choose modulo 97 (IBAN format)?
1. This gives us the possibility to catch ~99% of mistakes.
1. Easy to process/calculate.
1. Well known by financial institutions.

Calculation steps:

1. Replace letters with numbers
1. Calculate the remainder of the Account number when divided by 97
1. Subtract the result from 98
1. If one number is returned, prefix it with "0"

### BCAN

BCAN (basic crypto account number) uniquely identifies the address and/or identity owner.
40 characters (20 bytes) of Blockchain address.

### Network classification

#### ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes

CID | Network | Network id
--- | --- | ---
cb | mainnet | 1
ab | testnet | 3,4
ce | privatenet | >10

#### Tickers

Tickers are composed of CID prefixed with the "X" character.
They can be suffixed with assets running on the network.

This is technical recommendation. In the perspective of marketing and usability the asset can be used w/o prefix and network.

Example:
> XCB
> XABTKN
> XCBCTN

### Address structure

Symbol | Explanation
--- | ---
n | Digits (numeric characters 0 to 9 only).
a | Upper case letters (alphabetic characters A-Z only).
c | Upper and lower case alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z, and 0-9).
h | Hexadecimal characters (A-F, a-f, 0-9).
e | Blank space.
k | Check digits.
nn! | Fixed length.
nn | Maximum length.

#### Format

```
hh!kk!hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
```

#### Human and machine representation

Human representation has all letter uppercase and each group of 4 characters is divided into spaces.
The machine address is composed without any spaces.

Human address example:
> AB18 AB12 CD45 EF78 0369 0101 ABAB FFFF 0000 1234 5678

Machine address example:
> AB18AB12CD45EF7803690101ABABFFFF000012345678
> ab18ab12cd45ef7803690101ababffff000012345678

Note: For QR codes is the must capital letters in Alphanumeric mode.

#### Conversion table

 0  | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   | A   | B   | C   | D   | E   | F
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
 0  | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   | 10  | 11  | 12  | 13  | 14  | 15

## Rationale
<!-- The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during the discussion. -->
We use hexadecimal characters to minimize the size of the addresses in Blockchain. The first part — CID — reflects the type of the network to avoid misunderstanding of the type of address. We choose two digits checksum because it is already in use and it is easier to interpret while delivering the address in several cases. The third part showcases the last 40 characters (20 bytes) of the public key.

## Implementation
<!-- The implementations must be completed before any CIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the CIP is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details. -->

## Security Considerations
<!-- All CIPs must contain a section that discusses the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for security discussions, surface risks, and can be used throughout the life cycle of the proposal. CIP submissions missing the "Security Considerations" section will be rejected. A CIP cannot proceed to status "Final" without a Security Considerations discussion deemed sufficient by the reviewers. -->
40 characters (20 bytes) of Blockchain address.

Why 20 bytes?
1. Heuristic aimed to simplify the management of the key; that is, copy and pasting, checksums, or confirmations over the phone in large transfers.
1. Pre-empting security mechanism. Hashing functions are broken every other decade or so, hence cutting the full public key is a great extra layer of defense.
