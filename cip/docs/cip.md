# CIP

> The Core Improvement Proposal (CIP) sets standards for the Core platform, encompassing core protocol specifications, client APIs, and contract standards.

## Contributing

You can begin by opening your proposal under the [issues section of this repository](https://github.com/core-coin/cip/issues).

### Review

- [What is CIP](/docs/what-is-cip)
- [CIP rationale](/docs/cip-rationale)
- [CIP categories](/docs/cip-categories)
- [CIP workflow](/docs/cip-workflow)
- [CIP editors](/docs/cip-editors)
- [CIP example](/example/cip-0)

### How to start

1. Review the template [cip-0](https://github.com/core-coin/cip/blob/master/cip/example/cip-0.md)
2. [Create a CIP in the Online Editor](https://github.com/core-coin/cip/new/master?filename=cip/posts/cip-0.md&message=CIP%20Proposal&description=CIP%20Proposal%20Draft&value=---%0Acip%3A%20%0Atitle%3A%20%0Aauthor%3A%20%0Alang%3A%20en-US%0Atag%3A%20draft%0Acategory%3A%20%0Adate%3A%20%0A---%0A%0A)

Or

1. [Fork](https://github.com/core-coin/cip/fork) this repository.
2. Modify the template [cip-0](https://github.com/core-coin/cip/blob/master/cip/example/cip-0.md) and move it to the [`cip` folder](https://github.com/core-coin/cip/blob/master/cip/posts).
3. [Submit a Pull Request](https://github.com/core-coin/cip/compare) to the Core CIP repository.

For graphical content, place it in the [CIP image directory](https://github.com/core-coin/cip/blob/master/cip/.vuepress/public/images) `/cip/.vuepress/public/images/cip-x`, where 'x' is the CIP number. Link images using the path `/images/cip-x/cip-x-1.png`.

## CIP tags

- `Draft`: Consideration phase for a CIP.
- `Accepted`: A CIP set for immediate adoption, often slated for the next hard fork (relevant for Core/Consensus layer CIPs).
- `Final`: A CIP adopted in a prior hard fork (pertinent to Core/Consensus layer CIPs).
- `Deferred`: A CIP not up for immediate adoption, but might be reconsidered for future hard forks.

## CIP categories

CIPs are categorized into various types, each with its own list:

- **Core**: Improvements involving a consensus fork or changes significant to core development discussions.
- **Networking**: Enhancements concerning devp2p and network protocol specs for whisper and swarm.
- **Interface**: Focuses on client API/RPC specs, language standards like method names, and contract ABIs. Discussions should mainly take place in the interfaces repo before submitting a CIP here.
- **CBC**: Application standards and conventions like token standards and name registries.
- **Informational**: Addresses Core design issues or offers guidelines to the Core community without suggesting new features.
- **Meta**: Outlines processes around Core or proposes process changes. These are more binding than informational CIPs and often necessitate community consensus.
