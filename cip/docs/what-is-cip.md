# What is a CIP?

> CIP stands for Core Improvement Proposal.

A CIP is a design document providing information to the Core community, or describing a new feature for Core or its processes and environment. The CIP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature. The CIP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.
