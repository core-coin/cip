# CIP Rationale

CIPs are intended to serve as the primary mechanisms for proposing new features, gathering community technical feedback on an issue, and documenting the design decisions made within Core. Since CIPs are maintained as text files in a versioned repository, their revision history stands as the historical record of a feature's evolution.

For those implementing Core, CIPs offer a streamlined way to monitor the progress of their work. Ideally, each implementation maintainer would provide a list of the CIPs they have put into action. This approach would grant end users an easy reference to understand the current standing of a specific implementation or library.
