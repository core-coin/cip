CoreNFT: Non-Fungible Token Standard for Core Blockchain

<!--truncate-->

## Abstract

This standard defines the **CoreNFT** interface and provides an API for smart contracts to **track ownership**, **transfer NFTs**, and **enable interoperability** with wallets, marketplaces, and other decentralized applications on the Core Blockchain.

## Motivation

To ensure NFTs created on Core Blockchain can be seamlessly integrated with a wide range of wallets, marketplaces, and tools, **a consistent standard is essential**. Inspired by Ethereum's ERC-721, CoreNFT addresses the need for a native NFT protocol adapted to Core's architecture and optimizations.

## Specification

### Interfaces

#### CoreNFT (Required)

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

/// @title CoreNFT Standard Interface
interface CBC721 /* is CBC165 */ {
    event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 indexed tokenId);
    event Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed approved, uint256 indexed tokenId);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed owner, address indexed operator, bool approved);

    function balanceOf(address owner) external view returns (uint256);
    function ownerOf(uint256 tokenId) external view returns (address);

    function safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId, bytes calldata data) external payable;
    function safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId) external payable;

    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId) external payable;
    function approve(address approved, uint256 tokenId) external payable;
    function setApprovalForAll(address operator, bool approved) external;

    function getApproved(uint256 tokenId) external view returns (address);
    function isApprovedForAll(address owner, address operator) external view returns (bool);
}
```

#### Core165 (Required - Interface Detection)

```solidity
interface CBC165 {
    function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceID) external view returns (bool);
}
```

#### CoreNFTReceiver (Required for wallets/dApps that accept safe transfers)

```solidity
interface CBC721Receiver {
    function onCBC721Received(address operator, address from, uint256 tokenId, bytes calldata data) external returns (bytes4);
}
```

### Optional Extensions

#### CoreNFTMetadata (Optional)

```solidity
interface CBC721Metadata /* is CBC721 */ {
    function name() external view returns (string memory);
    function symbol() external view returns (string memory);
    function tokenURI(uint256 tokenId) external view returns (string memory);
}
```

#### CoreNFTEnumerable (Optional)

```solidity
interface CBC721Enumerable /* is CBC721 */ {
    function totalSupply() external view returns (uint256);
    function tokenByIndex(uint256 index) external view returns (uint256);
    function tokenOfOwnerByIndex(address owner, uint256 index) external view returns (uint256);
}
```

## Metadata JSON Schema

```json
{
  "title": "CoreNFT Metadata",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "name": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Name of the NFT"
    },
    "description": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Description of the NFT"
    },
    "image": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "URI of an image representing the NFT"
    }
  }
}
```

## Design Considerations

### Why Not CBC-20?

Each CoreNFT is **non-fungible** — unique and not interchangeable. Unlike CBC-20 (or Core20) tokens, each NFT has individual ownership, metadata, and identity.

### Identification

Each NFT is uniquely identified by a `uint256 tokenId` inside the contract. This ID **does not change** during the lifetime of the NFT. The combination of **contract address + tokenId** makes the NFT globally unique on Core Blockchain.

### Transfer Safety

* Use `safeTransferFrom()` for smart contract-to-contract transfers.
* Contracts should implement `onCoreNFTReceived()` to acknowledge receipt.
* If not implemented correctly, tokens may be lost (irrecoverably locked).

## Use Cases

* **Digital Collectibles**: Artwork, avatars, or gaming skins
* **Tokenized Assets**: Real estate, cars, luxury goods
* **Utility NFTs**: Access tokens, certificates, event tickets

## Best Practices

* Implement CoreNFTMetadata and CoreNFTEnumerable if user experience and discovery are priorities.
* Avoid unbounded loops to ensure scalability.
* Avoid assumptions about tokenId patterns — always treat them as opaque.

## Rationale

The CoreNFT standard provides a comprehensive framework for non-fungible tokens on the Core Blockchain. By defining clear interfaces for ownership tracking, transfer mechanisms, and metadata handling, this standard ensures interoperability across the Core ecosystem while maintaining the unique characteristics of NFTs.

## Backward Compatibility

This standard is designed to be compatible with existing NFT implementations and can work alongside other token standards on the Core Blockchain.

## Security Considerations

* Implement proper access controls for transfer and approval functions
* Use safe transfer methods when interacting with smart contracts
* Validate token ownership before allowing transfers
* Consider energy optimization for batch operations
* Ensure proper error handling for edge cases

## Conclusion

The CoreNFT standard provides a robust foundation for non-fungible tokens on the Core Blockchain, enabling seamless integration with wallets, marketplaces, and decentralized applications while maintaining the unique characteristics that make NFTs valuable.
