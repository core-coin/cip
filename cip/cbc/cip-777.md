A standardized smart contract interface for advanced token functionality on Core Blockchain (CBC), supporting operators, hooks, and improved composability over CBC-20.

<!--truncate-->

## Abstract

This standard defines an advanced token interface for Core Blockchain (CBC), introducing operator-based transfers, send/receive hooks, and improved composability compared to CBC-20. CBC-777 enables more flexible and secure token interactions, supporting use cases such as escrow, atomic swaps, and on-chain services.

## Motivation

CBC-20 tokens are widely used but have limitations, such as lack of hooks for sending/receiving tokens and inflexible approval mechanisms. CBC-777 addresses these issues by introducing operators (trusted accounts that can send tokens on behalf of others) and hooks (functions called on send/receive), enabling safer and more powerful token workflows for DeFi, gaming, and enterprise applications.

## Specification

### Interface

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

interface ICBC777 /* is ICBC165 */ {
    // --- Events ---
    event Sent(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 amount, bytes data, bytes operatorData);
    event Minted(address indexed operator, address indexed to, uint256 amount, bytes data, bytes operatorData);
    event Burned(address indexed operator, address indexed from, uint256 amount, bytes data, bytes operatorData);
    event AuthorizedOperator(address indexed operator, address indexed tokenHolder);
    event RevokedOperator(address indexed operator, address indexed tokenHolder);

    // --- Core Functions ---
    function name() external view returns (string memory);
    function symbol() external view returns (string memory);
    function granularity() external view returns (uint256);
    function totalSupply() external view returns (uint256);
    function balanceOf(address owner) external view returns (uint256);
    function send(address to, uint256 amount, bytes calldata data) external;
    function burn(uint256 amount, bytes calldata data) external;
    function isOperatorFor(address operator, address tokenHolder) external view returns (bool);
    function authorizeOperator(address operator) external;
    function revokeOperator(address operator) external;
    function operatorSend(address from, address to, uint256 amount, bytes calldata data, bytes calldata operatorData) external;
    function operatorBurn(address from, uint256 amount, bytes calldata data, bytes calldata operatorData) external;
    function defaultOperators() external view returns (address[] memory);
}
```

### Send and Receive Hooks

Contracts can register as senders or recipients to receive notifications via hooks. Hooks are discovered using CBC-165 interface detection.

```solidity
interface ICBC777Sender {
    function tokensToSend(address operator, address from, address to, uint256 amount, bytes calldata data, bytes calldata operatorData) external;
}

interface ICBC777Recipient {
    function tokensReceived(address operator, address from, address to, uint256 amount, bytes calldata data, bytes calldata operatorData) external;
}
```

#### Hook Registration and Discovery

- Contracts MUST implement CBC-165 and return `true` for the interface IDs of `ICBC777Sender` and/or `ICBC777Recipient` as appropriate.
- If a hook is not registered, the token contract MUST proceed without calling it.
- If a hook is registered but reverts, the token transfer MUST revert.
- If a contract does not implement the hook, tokens may be locked; implementers should take care to avoid accidental lockup.

### Default Operators

- CBC-777 supports a list of default operators (e.g., exchanges, custodians) that are operators for all token holders unless explicitly revoked by a holder.
- The `defaultOperators()` function returns the list of default operator addresses.
- Token holders can revoke or re-authorize default operators at any time.

### Method Behaviors

- The `granularity` function MUST return the smallest transferable unit (usually 1). All token amounts MUST be a multiple of granularity.
- The `send` and `operatorSend` functions MUST call the `tokensToSend` and `tokensReceived` hooks if registered.
- Operators MAY be authorized or revoked by token holders at any time. Default operators can be revoked per holder.
- Minting and burning MUST emit the appropriate events.
- Contracts implementing CBC-777 MUST implement CBC-165 `supportsInterface`.
- For CBC-20 compatibility, contracts MAY emit `Transfer` and `Approval` events as appropriate.

### Operator Authorization and Revocation

- Any address can be authorized as an operator by a token holder using `authorizeOperator`.
- Operators can be revoked at any time using `revokeOperator`.
- The `isOperatorFor` function returns `true` if the operator is authorized for the token holder, either directly or as a default operator (unless revoked).
- Operators can call `operatorSend` and `operatorBurn` on behalf of the token holder.

### Granularity and Decimals

- `granularity()` defines the smallest transferable unit. For most tokens, this MUST be 1.
- CBC-777 does not require a `decimals()` function, but it MAY be implemented for compatibility with CBC-20.

### Events

- All token movements (send, mint, burn) MUST emit the appropriate events (`Sent`, `Minted`, `Burned`).
- Operator authorization and revocation MUST emit `AuthorizedOperator` and `RevokedOperator` events.
- For CBC-20 compatibility, `Transfer` and `Approval` events MAY be emitted.

## Reference Implementation

A reference implementation can be provided upon request, following the CBC-777 interface and best practices for hooks and operator management.

## Rationale

CBC-777 improves on CBC-20 by enabling advanced token flows, such as escrow, atomic swaps, and on-chain services, through hooks and operator permissions. Default operators simplify integration with custodians and exchanges. This design increases security and composability for modern dApps.

## Backward Compatibility

CBC-777 is backward compatible with CBC-20. Implementers MAY include CBC-20 functions and events for compatibility with existing wallets and dApps. Dual implementation is recommended for maximum interoperability.

## Security Considerations

- Implementers must ensure hooks are only called on contracts that register for them (using CBC-165).
- Operator permissions should be managed carefully to prevent unauthorized transfers. Default operators should be chosen with care.
- Granularity should be set to prevent rounding errors and ensure divisibility is as intended.
- Upgradability and access control best practices should be followed.
- Reentrancy: Hooks can call back into the token contract. Use reentrancy guards where appropriate.
- Accidental token lockup: If tokens are sent to a contract that does not implement `tokensReceived`, they may be locked. User interfaces should warn users.
- Operator abuse: Token holders should be able to easily view and manage their operators.
