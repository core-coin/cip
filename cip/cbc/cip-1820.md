A universal registry smart contract where any address (contract or regular account) can register which interface it supports and which smart contract is responsible for its implementation. This standard keeps backward compatibility with CBC-165.

<!--truncate-->

## Abstract

This standard defines a registry where smart contracts and regular accounts can publish which functionality they implement---either directly or through a proxy contract.

Anyone can query this registry to ask if a specific address implements a given interface and which smart contract handles its implementation.

This registry MAY be deployed on any chain and shares the same address on all chains.

Interfaces with zeroes (`0`) as the last 28 bytes are considered CBC-165 interfaces,
and this registry SHALL forward the call to the contract to see if it implements the interface.

This contract also acts as an CBC-165 cache to reduce energy consumption.

## Motivation

There have been different approaches to define pseudo-introspection in Ethereum.
The first is CBC-165 which has the limitation that it cannot be used by regular accounts.
The second attempt is CBC-672 which uses reverse ENS. Using reverse ENS has two issues.
First, it is unnecessarily complicated, and second, ENS is still a centralized contract controlled by a multisig.
This multisig theoretically would be able to modify the system.

This standard is much simpler than CBC-672, and it is *fully* decentralized.

This standard also provides a *unique* address for all chains.
Thus solving the problem of resolving the correct registry address for different chains.

### Deployment Method

This contract is going to be deployed using the keyless deployment method - also known as Nick's method - which relies on a single-use address.
(See Nick's article for more details). This method works as follows:

1. Generate a transaction which deploys the contract from a new random account.
   - This transaction MUST NOT use CIP-155 in order to work on any chain.
   - This transaction MUST have a relatively high energy price to be deployed on any chain. In this case, it is going to be 100 Gwei.
2. Set the `v`, `r`, `s` of the transaction signature
3. We recover the sender of this transaction, i.e., the single-use deployment account.
    > Thus we obtain an account that can broadcast that transaction, but we also have the warranty that nobody knows the private key of that account.
4. Send exactly 0.08 ether to this single-use deployment account.
5. Broadcast the deployment transaction.

This operation can be done on any chain, guaranteeing that the contract address is always the same and nobody can use that address with a different contract.

### Single-use Registry Deployment Account

This account is generated by reverse engineering it from its signature for the transaction.
This way no one knows the private key, but it is known that it is the valid signer of the deployment transaction.

> To deploy the registry, 0.08 ether MUST be sent to this account *first*.

### Registry Contract Address

The contract has the address above for every chain on which it is deployed.

### Interface Name

Any interface name is hashed using `sha256` and sent to `getInterfaceImplementer()`.

If the interface is part of a standard, it is best practice to explicitly state the interface name and link to this published CBC-1820 such that other people don't have to come here to look up these rules.

For convenience, the registry provides a function to compute the hash on-chain:

``` solidity
function interfaceHash(string _interfaceName) public pure returns(bytes32)
```

Compute the sha256 hash of an interface given its name.

> **identifier:** `65ba36c1`
> **parameters**
> **_interfaceName**: Name of the interface.
> **returns:** The `sha256` hash of an interface name.

#### Approved CBCs

If the interface is part of an approved CBC, it MUST be named `CBC###XXXXX` where `###` is the number of the CBC and XXXXX should be the name of the interface in CamelCase.
The meaning of this interface SHOULD be defined in the specified CBC.

Examples:

- `sha256("CBC20Token")`
- `sha256("CBC777Token")`
- `sha256("CBC777TokensSender")`
- `sha256("CBC777TokensRecipient")`

#### CBC-165 Compatible Interfaces

> The compatibility with CBC-165, including the CBC-165 Cache, has been designed and developed with William Entriken.

Any interface where the last 28 bytes are zeroes (`0`) SHALL be considered an CBC-165 interface.

##### CBC-165 Lookup

Anyone can explicitly check if a contract implements an CBC-165 interface using the registry by calling one of the two functions below:

``` solidity
function implementsCBC165Interface(address _contract, bytes4 _interfaceId) public view returns (bool)
```

Checks whether a contract implements an CBC-165 interface or not.

If the result is not cached a direct lookup on the contract address is performed.

*NOTE*: If the result is not cached or the cached value is out-of-date, the cache MUST be updated manually by calling `updateCBC165Cache` with the contract address.
(See CBC-165 Cache for more details.)

> **identifier:** `f712f3e8`
> **parameters**
> **_contract**: Address of the contract to check.
> **_interfaceId**: CBC-165 interface to check.
> **returns:** `true` if `_contract` implements `_interfaceId`, `false` otherwise.

``` solidity
function implementsCBC165InterfaceNoCache(address _contract, bytes4 _interfaceId) public view returns (bool)
```

Checks whether a contract implements an CBC-165 interface or not without using nor updating the cache.

> **identifier:** `b7056765`
> **parameters**
> **_contract**: Address of the contract to check.
> **_interfaceId**: CBC-165 interface to check.
> **returns:** `true` if `_contract` implements `_interfaceId`, false otherwise.

#### CBC-165 Cache

Whether a contract implements an CBC-165 interface or not can be cached manually to save energy.

If a contract dynamically changes its interface and relies on the CBC-165 cache of the CBC-1820 registry, the cache MUST be updated manually - there is no automatic cache invalidation or cache update.
Ideally the contract SHOULD automatically update the cache when changing its interface.
However anyone MAY update the cache on the contract's behalf.

The cache update MUST be done using the `updateCBC165Cache` function:

``` solidity
function updateCBC165Cache(address _contract, bytes4 _interfaceId) external
```

> **identifier:** `a41e7d51`
> **parameters**
> **_contract**: Address of the contract for which to update the cache.
> **_interfaceId**: CBC-165 interface for which to update the cache.

#### **Private User-defined Interfaces**

This scheme is extensible.
You MAY make up your own interface name and raise awareness to get other people to implement it and then check for those implementations.
Have fun but please, you MUST not conflict with the reserved designations above.

### Set An Interface For An Address

For any address to set a contract as the interface implementation, it must call the following function of the CBC-1820 registry:

``` solidity
function setInterfaceImplementer(address _addr, bytes32 _interfaceHash, address _implementer) external
```

Sets the contract which implements a specific interface for an address.

Only the `manager` defined for that address can set it.
(Each address is the manager for itself, see the manager section for more details.)

*NOTE*: If  `_addr` and `_implementer` are two different addresses, then:

- The `_implementer` MUST implement the `CBC1820ImplementerInterface` (detailed below).
- Calling `canImplementInterfaceForAddress` on `_implementer` with the given `_addr` and  `_interfaceHash` MUST return the `CBC1820_ACCEPT_MAGIC` value.

*NOTE*: The `_interfaceHash` MUST NOT be an CBC-165 interface - it MUST NOT end with 28 zeroes (`0`).

*NOTE*: The `_addr` MAY be `0`, then `msg.sender` is assumed.
This default value simplifies interactions via multisigs where the data of the transaction to sign is constant regardless of the address of the multisig instance.

> **identifier:** `29965a1d`
> **parameters**
> **_addr**: Address for which to set the interface. (If `_addr` is the zero address then `msg.sender` is assumed.)
> **_interfaceHash**: Sha256 hash of the name of the interface as a string, for example `web3.utils.sha256('CBC777TokensRecipient')` for the CBC777TokensRecipient interface.
> **_implementer**: Contract implementing `_interfaceHash` for `_addr`.

### Get An Implementation Of An Interface For An Address

Anyone MAY query the CBC-1820 Registry to obtain the address of a contract implementing an interface on behalf of some address using the `getInterfaceImplementer` function.

``` solidity
function getInterfaceImplementer(address _addr, bytes32 _interfaceHash) external view returns (address)
```

Query if an address implements an interface and through which contract.

*NOTE*: If the last 28 bytes of the `_interfaceHash` are zeroes (`0`), then the first 4 bytes are considered an CBC-165 interface and the registry SHALL forward the call to the contract at `_addr` to see if it implements the CBC-165 interface (the first 4 bytes of `_interfaceHash`).
The registry SHALL also cache CBC-165 queries to reduce energy consumption. Anyone MAY call the `cbc165UpdateCache` function to update whether a contract implements an interface or not.

*NOTE*: The `_addr` MAY be `0`, then `msg.sender` is assumed.
This default value is consistent with the behavior of the `setInterfaceImplementer` function and simplifies interactions via multisigs where the data of the transaction to sign is constant regardless of the address of the multisig instance.

> **identifier:** `aabbb8ca`
> **parameters**
> **_addr**: Address being queried for the implementer of an interface. (If `_addr` is the zero address then `msg.sender` is assumed.)
> **_interfaceHash**: sha256 hash of the name of the interface as a string. E.g. `web3.utils.sha256('CBC777Token')`
> **returns:** The address of the contract which implements the interface `_interfaceHash` for `_addr` or `0` if `_addr` did not register an implementer for this interface.

### Interface Implementation (`CBC1820ImplementerInterface`)

``` solidity
interface CBC1820ImplementerInterface {
    /// @notice Indicates whether the contract implements the interface `interfaceHash` for the address `addr` or not.
    /// @param interfaceHash sha256 hash of the name of the interface
    /// @param addr Address for which the contract will implement the interface
    /// @return CBC1820_ACCEPT_MAGIC only if the contract implements `interfaceHash` for the address `addr`.
    function canImplementInterfaceForAddress(bytes32 interfaceHash, address addr) external view returns(bytes32);
}
```

Any contract being registered as the implementation of an interface for a given address MUST implement said interface.
In addition if it implements an interface on behalf of a different address, the contract MUST implement the `CBC1820ImplementerInterface` shown above.

``` solidity
function canImplementInterfaceForAddress(bytes32 interfaceHash, address addr) external view returns(bytes32)
```

Indicates whether a contract implements an interface (`interfaceHash`) for a given address (`addr`).

If a contract implements the interface (`interfaceHash`) for a given address (`addr`), it MUST return `CBC1820_ACCEPT_MAGIC` when called with the `addr` and the `interfaceHash`.
If it does not implement the `interfaceHash` for a given address (`addr`), it MUST NOT return `CBC1820_ACCEPT_MAGIC`.

> **identifier:** `f0083250`
> **parameters**
> **interfaceHash**: Hash of the interface which is implemented
> **addr**: Address for which the interface is implemented
> **returns:** `CBC1820_ACCEPT_MAGIC` only if the contract implements `ìnterfaceHash` for the address `addr`.

The special value `CBC1820_ACCEPT_MAGIC` is defined as the `sha256` hash of the string `"CBC1820_ACCEPT_MAGIC"`.

``` solidity
bytes32 constant internal CBC1820_ACCEPT_MAGIC = sha256(abi.encodePacked("CBC1820_ACCEPT_MAGIC"));
```

> The reason to return `CBC1820_ACCEPT_MAGIC` instead of a boolean is to prevent cases where a contract fails to implement the `canImplementInterfaceForAddress` but implements a fallback function which does not throw. In this case, since `canImplementInterfaceForAddress` does not exist, the fallback function is called instead, executed without throwing and returns `1`. Thus making it appear as if `canImplementInterfaceForAddress` returned `true`.

## Rationale

This standards offers a way for any type of address (externally owned and contracts) to implement an interface and potentially delegate the implementation of the interface to a proxy contract.
This delegation to a proxy contract is necessary for externally owned accounts and useful to avoid redeploying existing contracts such as multisigs and DAOs.

The registry can also act as a CBC-165 cache in order to save energy when looking up if a contract implements a specific CBC-165 interface.
This cache is intentionally kept simple, without automatic cache update or invalidation.
Anyone can easily and safely update the cache for any interface and any contract by calling the `updateCBC165Cache` function.

The registry is deployed using a keyless deployment method relying on a single-use deployment address to ensure no one controls the registry, thereby ensuring trust.

## Backward Compatibility

This standard is backward compatible with CBC-165, as both methods MAY be implemented without conflicting with each other.
