A standardized smart contract interface for approvals via signatures (CIP-712), enabling energyless approvals for CBC-20 tokens and similar standards.

<!--truncate-->

## Abstract

This standard defines a method for approvals via off-chain signatures (CIP-712), allowing users to approve token allowances for CBC-20 tokens without sending an on-chain transaction. CBC-2612 enables energyless approvals, improving UX and composability for wallets, dApps, and DeFi protocols.

## Motivation

Traditional CBC-20 approvals require users to send an on-chain transaction, incurring energy costs and requiring two transactions for many workflows (approve + transferFrom). CBC-2612 introduces a `permit` function, allowing approvals to be made via signed messages, enabling energyless approvals and meta-transactions.

## Specification

Compliant contracts MUST implement the following functions in addition to CBC-20:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

interface ICBC2612 /* is ICBC20 */ {
    function permit(
        address owner,
        address spender,
        uint256 value,
        uint256 deadline,
        uint8 v,
        bytes32 r,
        bytes32 s
    ) external;

    function nonces(address owner) external view returns (uint256);
    function DOMAIN_SEPARATOR() external view returns (bytes32);
}
```

The semantics are as follows:

For all addresses `owner`, `spender`, uint256s `value`, `deadline` and `nonce`, uint8 `v`, bytes32 `r` and `s`, a call to `permit(owner, spender, value, deadline, v, r, s)` MUST set `allowance[owner][spender]` to `value`, increment `nonces[owner]` by 1, and emit a corresponding `Approval` event, IF and ONLY IF all the following conditions are met:

- The current blocktime is less than or equal to `deadline`.
- `owner` is not the zero address.
- `nonces[owner]` (before the state update) is equal to `nonce`.
- `r`, `s` and `v` is a valid secp256k1 signature from `owner` of the message:

```solidity
sha256(abi.encodePacked(
   hex"1901",
   DOMAIN_SEPARATOR,
   sha256(abi.encode(
            sha256("Permit(address owner,address spender,uint256 value,uint256 nonce,uint256 deadline)"),
            owner,
            spender,
            value,
            nonce,
            deadline))
))
```

where `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` is defined according to CIP-712. The `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` should be unique to the contract and chain to prevent replay attacks from other domains, and satisfy the requirements of CIP-712, but is otherwise unconstrained. A common choice for `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` is:

```solidity
DOMAIN_SEPARATOR = sha256(
    abi.encode(
        sha256('CIP712Domain(string name,string version,uint256 chainId,address verifyingContract)'),
        sha256(bytes(name)),
        sha256(bytes(version)),
        chainid,
        address(this)
));
```

The message is the CIP-712 typed structure:

```json
{
  "types": {
    "CIP712Domain": [
      { "name": "name", "type": "string" },
      { "name": "version", "type": "string" },
      { "name": "chainId", "type": "uint256" },
      { "name": "verifyingContract", "type": "address" }
    ],
    "Permit": [
      { "name": "owner", "type": "address" },
      { "name": "spender", "type": "address" },
      { "name": "value", "type": "uint256" },
      { "name": "nonce", "type": "uint256" },
      { "name": "deadline", "type": "uint256" }
    ]
  },
  "primaryType": "Permit",
  "domain": {
    "name": cbc20name,
    "version": version,
    "chainId": chainid,
    "verifyingContract": tokenAddress
  },
  "message": {
    "owner": owner,
    "spender": spender,
    "value": value,
    "nonce": nonce,
    "deadline": deadline
  }
}
```

The caller of the `permit` function can be any address. If any of the above conditions are not met, the call MUST revert.

### Method Behaviors

- The `permit` function MUST set `spender`'s allowance over `owner`'s tokens to `value` if a valid signature is provided, and MUST increment the owner's nonce.
- The `permit` function MUST revert if the signature is invalid or expired.
- The `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` MUST be implemented according to CIP-712.
- The `nonces` function MUST return the current nonce for an address.
- The `Approval` event MUST be emitted on a successful permit.

## Backward Compatibility

There are existing `permit` functions in some token contracts (e.g., DAI, Stake) with different semantics:

- DAI uses a `bool allowed` instead of a `value` argument, and `expiry` instead of `deadline`.
- Stake allows expiring approvals, only permitting `transferFrom` while `expiry >= block.timestamp`.

CBC-2612 aligns with the Uniswap V2 implementation and the CBC-20 standard, using `value` and `deadline` as specified above. The requirement to revert if the permit is invalid is consistent with all major implementations.

## Reference Implementation

A reference implementation can be provided upon request, following the CBC-2612 interface and best practices for signature verification and nonce management.

## Rationale

CBC-2612 improves UX and composability by enabling energyless approvals, reducing friction for users and enabling new workflows for wallets and dApps.

## Security Considerations

- Implementers must ensure signatures are unique and cannot be replayed (use nonces).
- The `permit` function must be resistant to signature malleability.
- The `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` must be unique per contract and chain.
- Upgradability and access control best practices should be followed.
