Standard for Publishing Lab Certificates as On-Chain Metadata

<!--truncate-->

## Abstract

In physical goods verification and tokenized commodity markets, lab reports are critical to establish product quality, purity, or authenticity. This standard defines:

- The key `"lab"` to be used in on-chain KV metadata.
- The required file name `lab.json`.
- Expected format for the contents of the certificate, supporting structured fields with units.

The value associated with the `"lab"` key MUST point to the off-chain file (e.g. IPFS or other decentralized storage). The JSON file MUST be immutable, versioned, and cryptographically verifiable.

## Motivation

A growing number of asset-backed tokens (e.g. coffee beans, precious metals, food, chemicals, pharmaceuticals) need to attach lab-verified attributes such as:

- Moisture content
- pH
- Color
- Presence of contaminants
- Protein or ash content

These properties are typically stored off-chain in PDF or JSON files, without on-chain standardization or discoverability. This CIP enables reliable on-chain discovery of lab reports using a well-defined pattern.

## Specification

### Key: `"lab"`

- This key must be stored using a CIP-compliant key-value metadata contract.
- The key must be: `lab`
- The value must be a URL or content-addressed reference to a JSON file (e.g. IPFS CID).

Example:

```txt
key: "lab"
value: "ipfs://QmXabc123.../lab.json"
```

### File Name: `lab.json`

- The filename MUST be `lab.json` to signal standardization.
- It should be referenced by the `lab` key.

### Expected JSON Structure

A `lab.json` file SHOULD contain a flat structure of property objects, each including:

- `value`: Numeric or string value
- `unit`: Optional unit field

Example 1:

```json
{
  "moisture": { "value": 9.7, "unit": "percent" },
  "SO2": { "value": 4.83, "unit": "ppm" },
  "pH": { "value": 6.51 },
  "protein": { "value": 0.31, "unit": "percent" },
  "ASH": { "value": 0, "unit": "percent" },
  "color": { "value": "white" }
}
```

Example 2 (identical structure with different values):

```json
{
  "moisture": { "value": 10.1, "unit": "percent" },
  "SO2": { "value": 3.15, "unit": "ppm" },
  "pH": { "value": 6.45 },
  "protein": { "value": 0.25, "unit": "percent" },
  "ASH": { "value": 0.02, "unit": "percent" },
  "color": { "value": "beige" }
}
```

## Enforcement and Sealing

- The `"lab"` entry SHOULD be sealed using `sealKey("lab")` after it is published.
- If multiple lab reports exist over time, consider storing versioned keys:
  - `"lab_v1"`, `"lab_v2"`, with `"lab"` always pointing to the latest.

## Storage and Format

- The JSON file SHOULD be stored on IPFS, Arweave, or similar immutable content-addressed storage.
- The `value` in KV is recommended to be the IPFS CID (e.g. `"ipfs://..."`) or full URL.

## Use Cases

- Tokenized food, beverages, commodities
- Pharmaceutical tracking (e.g. generic ingredients)
- Energy, water, or industrial emissions
- Precious metal or gemstone verification

## Rationale

The lab certificate standard addresses the critical need for verifiable quality and authenticity data in tokenized physical assets. By providing a consistent structure and on-chain discoverability, this standard enables trust and transparency in commodity markets while maintaining the flexibility needed for diverse analytical requirements.

## Backward Compatibility

This standard is fully compatible with CIP-KV-Metadata and may be embedded as part of broader metadata systems (e.g. tokenURI JSON can also reference lab.json).

## Security Considerations

- Make sure the referenced `lab.json` is immutable and hosted in trusted decentralized storage.
- Consider signing the file with a lab's cryptographic signature (optional extension).
- Do not store unverified lab reports without a sealing mechanism.

## Conclusion

The Standard for Publishing Lab Certificates as On-Chain Metadata provides a reliable and standardized approach to linking verifiable lab reports with tokenized assets. Its adoption can enhance trust, transparency, and compliance in physical asset tokenization.
